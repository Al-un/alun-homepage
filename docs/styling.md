#### CSS Variables

CSS Variables can be defined in `.scss` file but to allow theme toggling, it is initialised by JavaScript. However, because of that, the following does not work:

```css
@media print
  .al-cv{
    --al-cv-base-size: 0.8rem;
  }
```

And print specific variables must be defined before printing.
